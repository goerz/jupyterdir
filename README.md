Jupyter Config Directory
------------------------

This configuration goes into `~/.jupyter`. It handles the Jupyter Notebook, as
well as jupyter (formerly ipython) console and qtconsole.

Note that the IPython REPL and the IPython kernel still have additional
configuration in    ~/.ipython`

See the
[Jupyter manual](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects/config.html)
for details. Also see the [Ipython to Jupyter Migration
Guide](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migrating.html) on how the
Jupyter configuration relates to the older IPython
